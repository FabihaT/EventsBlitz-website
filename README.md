# EventsBlitz

### SENG 401 - Software Architecture

Events Blitz is a web-based platform to create, manage, and organize events. Our platform provides tools and features to support event organizers and attendees, empowering them to create and participate in events seamlessly. There will be two types of access to the system, one will be the admin and the other will be the user. We have utilized a hybrid architecture combining MVC ( Model-View-Controller) and Microservices architecture. The Model component serves as the backbone of our system, managing all data operations within a centralized Google Cloud SQL database.  At the same time, the user interface is designed with React which offers a smooth and intuitive experience, enabling seamless interaction and responsiveness in real-time. To ensure robust backend functionality, we leverage Java and SpringBoot for REST API development, streamlining communication with the database and other services. EventsBlitz provides a complete solution for managing events by providing various features such as viewing events, booking and receiving confirmation, viewing tickets, and canceling. Furthermore, we utilized JUnit and Jest testing to verify the complete functionality of our frontend and backend applications and their seamless communication. In this project, we employ aspects of the software development life cycle to plan, build, test, and deploy our website.
